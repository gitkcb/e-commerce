# E-commerce
my github profile: https://github.com/gitkcb/e-commerce
## Description
This project was motivated by creating a back-end application for a internet retail company. This can obtain, add, update, and delete inventory information for products. This gives the owner of an e-commerce business an easy way to access and change as their company does. I learned how to create models and API route paths. 


## Usage
On Insomnia you can retrieve,add, update, and delete products, tags, and categories by their ids.
